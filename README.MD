# Guide to Deploying an Application with Java 17 and Spring Boot 3

This guide will help you set up and deploy a web application using Java 17 and Spring Boot 3.

## Prerequisites

- JDK 17 installed on your system
- Maven or Gradle installed (depending on your preference)
- A code editor (e.g., VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

## Steps

1. **Environment Setup:**

    - Ensure JDK 17 is installed and configured correctly on your system. You can verify the installation by typing `java -version` in the terminal/cmd.

    - Install Maven or Gradle, depending on your preference. Verify the installation by typing `mvn -v` or `gradle -v`.

2. **Create a Spring Boot Project:**

    - You can create a new Spring Boot project using the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) or via the Spring Boot CLI.

    - Example CLI command to create a new project with Spring Boot:

        ```
        spring init --name tasks --groupId com.example --artifactId tasks --dependencies web,data-jpa,postgres
        ```

3. **Application Development:**

    - Implement your business logic and application controllers according to your requirements.

4. **Database Configuration (Optional):**

    - If your application requires a database, configure the database connection properties in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.

5. **Build and Run:**

    - To compile and run your Spring Boot application, you can use Maven or Gradle. Use the following command at the root of your project:

        ```
        mvn spring-boot:run
        ```

        or

        ```
        ./gradlew bootRun
        ```

6. **Accessing the Application:**

    - After successfully starting the application, you can access it at `http://localhost:8080` (unless you've specified a different port).

## Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions during the setup or execution of the application, feel free to create an issue in this repository or seek help on developer forums or online communities.

Enjoy developing with Java 17 and Spring Boot 3!
